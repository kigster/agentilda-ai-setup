    # `plan.md` is written by an agent for humans, not as a data file, so this
    # reads the one structure the format has always had: a heading per unit,
    # naming the pull request it will become. Everything else is prose about
    # those units.
    #
    # Two things about real plans make that harder than it sounds, and both
    # were found by running this over thirty-eight of them:
    #
    #   * The unit headings are all at one level, but *which* level varies by
    #     document — `## PR-1 — …` in one plan, `### PR 020.01 — …` in the
    #     next. Deeper headings underneath them (`### PR-1 tests`) name the
    #     same unit again. Matching every heading that mentions a pull request
    #     turned one plan's three units into nine.
    #   * A plan numbers its units either from one (`PR-1`) or from its own
    #     spec number (`PR 020.01`). The second form is the first form with
    #     the plan's number glued on, so it is normalised back.
    #
    # A plan with no such headings is not an error. Retroactive plans have no
    # `plan.md` at all, and a small plan is often one pull request with no
    # internal divisions — both import as a single issue standing for the
    # whole plan, which is the honest reading of a plan that never divided
    # itself.
