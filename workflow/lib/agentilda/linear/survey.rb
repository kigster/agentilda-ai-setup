    # What a team already has in Linear, set against what `.plans` holds.
    #
    # This exists because the import cannot see Linear at all — that is the
    # property that makes its dry run trustworthy — and the cost of that
    # property is a blind spot: a plan whose project someone already made by
    # hand looks, from disk, exactly like a plan that has none. Proposing to
    # create it would quietly produce a second project beside the first.
    #
    # So the reconciliation is its own read-only command rather than something
    # smuggled into the import. It answers one question — *is anything here
    # already in Linear under a different name?* — and answers it by showing
    # both lists rather than by guessing.
