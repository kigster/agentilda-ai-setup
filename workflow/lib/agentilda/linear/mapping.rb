    # What a folder's state means to Linear.
    #
    # Linear gives every workflow state a *type* — one of five, fixed across
    # every workspace — and a *name*, which each team chooses for itself. A
    # team may call its started state "In Progress", "Doing" or "🚧 WIP", so
    # matching on the name alone works right up until it meets somebody else's
    # workspace. Each row here therefore carries both: the type, which is the
    # contract, and the name we would prefer if the team happens to have one.
    # {Push} resolves the name first and falls back to the type.
    #
    # Several states have no Linear equivalent at all — ⭕️ Technical Block is
    # a reason, not a position in a workflow — so they map to the nearest
    # position and carry a label saying which reason.
    #
    # Two states are left out entirely; see {UNPLACED}.
    #
    # @!attribute [r] type
    #   @return [String] Linear's canonical type: backlog, unstarted, started,
    #     completed or canceled
    # @!attribute [r] name
    #   @return [String] the state name to prefer when the team has one
    # @!attribute [r] labels
    #   @return [Array<String>] labels that carry what the type cannot
