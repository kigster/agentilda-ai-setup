  # requests and a document saying why. What they are not is visible to anyone
  # who does not have the repository checked out, which is most of the people
  # who want to know how a piece of work is going. This exports to Linear so
  # that audience can see it, and it exports *one way* — the folder is the
  # truth, Linear is the window.
  #
  # Four pieces, in the order a run uses them:
  #
  #   {Units}   reads `plan.md` and finds the work units inside a plan
  #   {Import}  decides, from disk alone, what would be created or updated
  #   {Push}    applies that through {API} and records what it did
  #   {Issues}  is the record, `linear.md`, that makes the next run idempotent
  #
  # {Import} touches nothing but the filesystem, which is what makes the dry
  # run trustworthy: it is not a description of what a push would do, it is
  # the object the push consumes.
