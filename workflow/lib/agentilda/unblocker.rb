  # Draining a plan's `blocked.md`, and saying what happened.
  #
  # `unblock` is the one command a human runs *because* they know something the
  # tool cannot observe: an answer has arrived. So it owes them an account of
  # what it did with it. Four things can happen to a plan named on the command
  # line, and only one of them is the interesting one:
  #
  #   * the number names no folder,
  #   * the folder is not blocked and there is nothing to drain,
  #   * the folder is blocked, and some, none or all of its questions fold in,
  #   * `blocked.md` is there but numbers nothing `## B<n>`, so no program can
  #     read it at all.
  #
  # Each is reported differently, because each needs a different thing done
  # next. This object works out which one happened; {CLI::Unblock} prints it.
