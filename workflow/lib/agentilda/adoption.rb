module Agentilda
  # Gives a plan folder to every pull request that has no plan to point at.
  #
  # `resync prs` can resolve most pull requests from their branch or their
  # diff. What it cannot resolve it used to flag for a human — "diff touches
  # 021.00, 022.00, 024.00 and none is obviously primary" — and stop. That is
  # honest but not useful: the work exists, it is unspecified, and leaving it
  # unnumbered means it never appears in the index at all.
  #
  # So an orphan is adopted instead. It gets a retroactive plan of its own,
  # numbered in the gap after the furthest plan it can see, holding the pull
  # request that produced it.
  #
  # == Why the numbering is allocated serially
  #
  # The obvious parallel design — every worker reads the highest number and
  # adds `.01` — is deterministic but not unique, and the collision is the
  # common case rather than the rare one. Fifteen open pull requests branched
  # off the same main all see the same highest number and all compute the same
  # slot. Determinism is not the property that matters here; distinctness is.
  #
  # So the pipeline is **gather in parallel, allocate serially, apply in
  # parallel**. The allocation is pure arithmetic over an array that is
  # already in memory, so the serial section costs microseconds; the two
  # expensive phases — reading each branch and writing each folder — keep the
  # whole fan-out. And because the slots are handed out before any worker
  # starts, no worker can want a number another worker holds: no locks, no
  # retries, and the same input produces the same numbers every run.
