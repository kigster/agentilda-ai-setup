  # Telling "this belongs to no specification" apart from "nobody could tell".
  #
  # Both end up without a plan number, and filing them under one marker loses
  # the difference between a finished thought and an open question. A
  # dependency bump genuinely implements no specification and never will —
  # that is an assertion, and `[dev]` records it. A pull request that adds
  # Schedule K-1 for four tax years plainly implements *something*; nothing
  # here could work out what, and `[none]` records that instead, as a job left
  # for a human rather than a verdict.
  #
  # The bar for `[dev]` is deliberately high. Marking real work as `[dev]`
  # tells everyone afterwards it was never worth a plan, and nobody re-opens a
  # question that looks settled. `[none]` is visibly unfinished, so the cost of
  # guessing wrong in that direction is somebody spending a minute on it.
