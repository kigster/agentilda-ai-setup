  # What an agent is doing, while it is still doing it.
  #
  # `claude -p` prints nothing until it exits, so a fifteen-minute agent used to
  # sit behind a spinner that said only its name. Asked for `--output-format
  # stream-json` it emits one JSON object per line as it works, and this turns
  # that stream into the short phrase a spinner line has room for: "editing
  # spec.md", "reading plan.md", whatever the agent last said about itself.
  #
  # Three things make this less trivial than parsing JSON.
  #
  # Chunks arrive from `readpartial`, so a line is split across two of them as
  # often as not. {#push} buffers and only ever parses whole lines.
  #
  # Not every line is JSON. `claude` reports its own failures as prose on
  # stdout, and the 401 that cost a whole run three minutes an agent was one of
  # those. Those lines are kept in {#plain} so a failure can still be explained
  # by what was actually printed.
  #
  # The reader runs on its own thread, so {#activity} is written from one
  # thread and read from another. It is a single assignment of an immutable
  # string, which is why there is no lock here.
  #
  # Every line is also kept verbatim in an optional trace file, written before
  # anything is made of it, so a run that failed can be read back afterwards
  # even where this parser made nothing of an event it had never seen. See
  # {Executor::TRACE_DIR} for where those land and how to read one.
