  # A plan's number, and therefore its identity. Set once when the folder is
  # created and never changed: branch names, pull request titles and every
  # `pull-requests.md` join on it, and renumbering breaks all of them silently.
  #
  # Always rendered `NNN.MM`. `002.00` is an ordinary plan, specified before it
  # was built. `002.01` is retroactive — work that shipped between 002 and 003
  # and was documented afterwards. The decimal marks a **sibling**, not
  # containment: 002.01 is not part of 002.
  #
  # `000` is where the sequence starts, so the first plan of a project is
  # `000.00`. It also absorbs the older meaning — work that predates the plan
  # discipline — since either way it sorts first, which is where it belongs.
