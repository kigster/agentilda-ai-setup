  # mermaid block, for a browser. This is the same machine, walked the same
  # way, shaped for a terminal instead: unicode arrows, no browser required.

  # Every section below is read off {StateMachine} and {STATUSES} rather than
  # drawn by hand, for the reason {Documentation} gives for doing the same
  # thing: three hand-maintained pictures of this machine have already
  # drifted apart once, and a fourth is not the fix.
