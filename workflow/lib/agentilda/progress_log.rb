module Agentilda
  # One line of `run --log FILE`, laid out as fixed-width columns.
  #
  # The log file is the only record of a headless run, and it is shared: two
  # `agentilda run` invocations pointed at the same `--log` both append to
  # it, interleaved, and so does every round within one run. That is what the
  # process id column is for. Without it a reader cannot tell one run's agents
  # from another's, and "started 003.00" twice looks like a bug rather than two
  # machines doing the same work.
  #
  # Fixed columns are what make the file readable by eye and by `awk` alike. A
  # value wider than its column is cut rather than allowed to push the columns
  # out, and a value that is missing still occupies its width, so a round header
  # with no plan or agent of its own lines up with the lines underneath it.
  #
  # @example
  #   ProgressLog.render("editing spec.md", plan: "003.00", status: "⭐️ Planned",
  #     agent: "yoda-writer", seconds: 42, pid: 91_234)
  #   #=> "[16:22:14 | 003.00 | ⭐️ Planned            | yoda-writer          |   91234 |    42s] editing spec.md"
