    # transport unchanged: {Push} turns it into GraphQL, and the skill hands
    # it to the MCP tools as-is. One contract, so the two cannot drift.

    # something a human curated, and every plan is filed under one the caller
    # named on the command line.

    # dry run is not an approximation of what a push would do — it is the same
    # object the push consumes, so what gets printed and what gets sent cannot
    # disagree. Everything that needs the network — the project, the repository
    # pull request list — is handed in.
