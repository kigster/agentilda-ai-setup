        Every project keeps its plans in a `#{SpecPlanBuild::PLANS_DIR}/` directory at its root.
        Each medium-to-large feature gets one folder, and the folder's **name is its
        state**: the number identifies it forever, the emoji says what phase it is in,
        and the slug says what it is.

        There are three phases, and each one has a file that proves it happened:

        | Phase | State | The file that proves it |
        | :---- | :---- | :---------------------- |
        | **spec** | #{status(:new).emoji} #{status(:new).label} | `spec.md` |
        | **plan** | #{status(:planned).emoji} #{status(:planned).label} | `plan.md` |
        | **build** | #{status(:building).emoji} → #{status(:ready_for_review).emoji} → #{status(:in_review).emoji} → #{status(:approved).emoji} | `pull-requests.md` |

        Those files are not paperwork. They are what the tool checks: a folder may not
        claim a phase whose file is missing, and `spec-plan-build resync dirs` renames
        any folder whose emoji its contents do not support.

    def numbering
      <<~MARKDOWN
        ## The number

        A plan's number is its identity. It is set once, when the folder is created,
        and never changes: branch names, pull request titles and every
        `pull-requests.md` join on it, and renumbering breaks all of them silently.

        The shape is always `NNN.MM`:

        ```
        #{SpecPlanBuild::PLANS_DIR}/000.00-#{status(:new).emoji}-initial-spec
        #{SpecPlanBuild::PLANS_DIR}/001.00-#{status(:approved).emoji}-dev-foundation
        #{SpecPlanBuild::PLANS_DIR}/001.01-#{status(:approved).emoji}-schedule-k1-backfill   <- shipped between 001 and 002,
        #{SpecPlanBuild::PLANS_DIR}/002.00-#{status(:planned).emoji}-tenancy-households        specified afterwards
        ```

        - **`NNN` counts from `000`.** The first plan of a project is `000.00`; after
          that it is the highest major plus one, zero-padded to three digits.
        - **`MM` is `00` for an ordinary plan** — one specified before it was built.
        - **`MM` from `01` to `99` marks a retroactive plan**: work that shipped with no
          specification, documented after the fact. `spec-plan-build create --after 001`
          takes the next free slot in the gap after 001.

        `001.01` is a **sibling of 001 that arrived later, not a part of 001**. The dot
        reads as containment in almost every other numbering scheme, and here it does
        not — which is worth saying wherever the scheme is described, because the
        containment reading is the one a new reader brings.

        Two digits, always. One would sort into the middle of the two-digit range —
        `001.09` < `001.1` < `001.10` — so a single mixed-width folder silently
        reorders the index. Two digits also retire the question of running out: 99
        slots per gap, against a gap that closes the moment the next plan is created.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Padding every plan to `NNN.MM` is a deliberate choice, and it costs something.
        > A bare `018` next to `018.01` would have told you at a glance which plan was
        > specified in advance and which was written afterwards. With uniform padding
        > that distinction is no longer readable from the number alone — it is carried
        > by `MM > 0`, which you have to know to look for. What padding buys is
        > alignment and one shape to parse everywhere.

        **A retroactive `spec.md` must open with a dated line saying so**, naming the
        pull requests it describes. It documents what exists; it does not pretend to
        have decided anything in advance. Anchor by *when the work merged*, not by what
        it is about — compare merge dates against folder creation dates
        (`git log --diff-filter=A`). Anchoring by topic invites an argument nobody can
        settle, and the number is a slot, not a claim about subject matter.

      <<~MARKDOWN
        ## Starting a feature that does not exist yet

        `spec-plan-build create <two to five words>` mints the folder at #{status(:new).emoji} #{status(:new).label}
        and, for a genuinely new feature, scaffolds `spec.md` with a title and four
        headings, verbatim:

        #{headings}

        It then makes a best-effort attempt at each from what the project already
        has on disk — its own docs, `#{SpecPlanBuild::Brief::BACKLOG_FILE}` when the project keeps one,
        anything already downloaded or already built that bears on the topic — and
        opens the result for a human to finish. `--no-draft` skips the attempt and
        leaves the headings bare; `--no-open` leaves the file for you to open.

        **Nothing else belongs in that first pass.** It writes no `## Goals`, no
        `## Non-Goals`, no conclusions — deciding those before `leah-researcher` and
        `yoda-writer` have looked is choosing the answer before the research runs.
        Above all, it writes no heading beginning with the word "Research": that
        heading is not decoration, it is the #{status(:researched).emoji} #{status(:researched).label} invariant, so writing
        one — even empty — flips the folder's state out from under whoever reads it
        next, and the research nobody did gets skipped rather than assigned.

        This is only for work that does not exist yet. `create --after <plan> --prs
        <n,...>` is the other path — the work already shipped, so `yoda-writer`
        reconstructs the specification from the pull requests instead of guessing at
        a feature that has no facts yet to guess from.

      rows = SpecPlanBuild::STATUSES.map do |s|

      end

        ## The states

        | Symbol | Meaning | Key | Files required | Description |
        | :----: | :------ | :-- | :------------- | :---------- |
        #{rows.join("\n")}

        "Files required" is a **minimum**, not an exact match: a #{status(:new).emoji} folder that
        has grown a `plan.md` still satisfies #{status(:new).emoji}, and is #{status(:planned).emoji} anyway. That is
        why `resync dirs` moves a folder to the furthest state its contents justify
        rather than only fixing outright lies.

        Some states share their requirements on purpose, and are told apart only by the
        folder name. #{status(:blocked).emoji} #{status(:blocked).label} and #{status(:product_blocked).emoji} #{status(:product_blocked).label} both mean "a human must
        decide before this can move"; *which* human is recorded nowhere but the emoji.
        #{StateMachine::FAMILIES.last.map { |k| status(k).emoji }.join(" ")} all mean "the work exists and pull requests are open"; whether
        anyone has started reviewing is written down nowhere either.

        So nothing re-derives one of them from a folder's contents — otherwise every
        #{status(:blocked).emoji} would silently become #{status(:product_blocked).emoji} the first time anything resynced. A folder
        falling back into that group from outside lands on its weakest member,
        #{status(StateMachine::FAMILIES.last.first).emoji} #{status(StateMachine::FAMILIES.last.first).label}, because that is all its contents can prove.

        A bare promote walks the **spine** — spec → plan → build. Everything off it
        (blocking, deferring, rejecting) has to be named explicitly. That is the whole
        reason there is a machine here rather than a rename: a transition is refused
        when the destination's requirements are not already met, and that refusal is
        information — it means the phase has not actually happened yet.

    def pull_requests
      <<~MARKDOWN
        ## Pull requests carry the number

        A pull request that implements a plan says so in its title:

        ```
        [003.00] Make the core deterministic and require as_of
        ```

        `pull-requests.md` is generated from these titles, so the prefix is the join key
        between a pull request and a plan, not decoration. Name branches
        `<user>/NNN.MM-slug` and the number carries itself from branch creation through
        to a merged, squashed pull request with nobody having to remember it.

        `spec-plan-build resync prs` fills in missing prefixes. It reads the branch name
        first and falls back to the diff only when that touches exactly one plan folder.
        **It refuses rather than guessing.** A wrong number does not announce itself: it
        files the work under a plan that did not do it, and leaves the plan that did
        looking untouched.

        ### `[#{SpecPlanBuild::NO_PLAN_PREFIX}]` when there is no plan

        Not every pull request implements a feature. Dependency bumps, CI configuration,
        hotfixes and developer tooling implement no plan, and forcing a number onto them
        produces a number chosen to satisfy the rule. Those are titled:

        ```
        [#{SpecPlanBuild::NO_PLAN_PREFIX}] Bump json from 2.21.1 to 2.21.2
        ```

        `#{SpecPlanBuild::NO_PLAN_PREFIX}` means **"this deliberately belongs to no specification"**, and it
        exists so that "no plan" is *asserted* rather than merely absent. A title with no
        prefix is ambiguous between "no plan applies" and "nobody looked".

        `resync prs` will propose it, but marks every such title as **assumed** and never
        applies one without you seeing it. Emitting it silently on a failed lookup would
        launder "I could not tell" into "there is definitely none", which is the same
        lie as guessing a number, told in the other direction.

        ### What does not deserve a retroactive plan

        Most unmatched pull requests. The test is whether **somebody would need to read
        it** — a capability with behaviour, an interface, or invariants that are not
        obvious from the code. "Fix a typo", "remove dead code" and "bump a dependency"
        are `[#{SpecPlanBuild::NO_PLAN_PREFIX}]` and always were. Backfilling those produces an index that is
        longer without being more informative, which makes the real plans harder to find.

        ## If a real issue tracker arrives, this scheme retires

        This numbering is homegrown because there is nothing else to join on. If the
        work moves to Linear or Jira, **the issue key replaces it**: `[EQL-142] <title>`
        in pull request titles, `EQL-142-<status>-<slug>` for the folder, and the issue
        becomes the thing `pull-requests.md` is generated against.

        Recording that matters more than it looks. A numbering scheme with no stated
        exit becomes permanent by default: it accretes tooling, the tooling accretes
        rules, and by the time a real tracker shows up, migrating is a project rather
        than a decision. The exit is cheap only while it is written down and unbuilt.

        Two things to hold to when that day comes:

        - **Existing numbers are not rewritten.** A plan's number is its identity and
          merged pull request titles are immutable history. `000` stays `000` forever and
          new plans start taking issue keys. A mixed index is ugly for a while and honest
          permanently, which beats a renumbering that breaks every link that ever pointed
          at a plan.
        - **Do not teach the tooling to accept issue keys before the tracker exists.** A
          validator that accepts `[EQL-142]` with nothing to check it against is a guard
          that passes anything shaped like an answer, which is worse than one that fails
          loudly on first use.
