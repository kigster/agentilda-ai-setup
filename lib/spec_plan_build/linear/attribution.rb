    # Which plan a pull request belongs to, when its title does not say.
    #
    # `resync prs` puts an `[NNN.MM]` on every title it can resolve, and most
    # of them resolve. What is left is the tail: work that shipped before the
    # convention existed, or from a branch named after nothing in particular.
    # Those pull requests are real work with no home, and dropping them means
    # the issues that stand for a plan are missing pieces of it.
    #
    # The rule is word overlap between the pull request's title and the
    # folder's name. It works here, where it did not work for matching plans
    # to projects, because the candidates are different: a folder slug is
    # `ledger-carryforward-vintages`, three specific words about one thing,
    # and there are twenty of them to choose between. A project is called
    # "US Tax Law: Self Contained Ruby Gem" and there are four.
    #
    # It is still a guess, and it says so. A tie is refused rather than broken,
    # because two folders matching equally well is evidence that neither is
    # right rather than a reason to pick the first.
