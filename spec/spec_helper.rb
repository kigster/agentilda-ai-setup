# without it the whole suite dies there — which reports as a passing run
# followed by a stack trace.

  # to load, so a library nobody requires reports 100% of nothing. With it, an
  # untested file counts as 0% AND the report is restricted to this pattern —
  # which is also why `spec/` and `bin/` need no separate exclusion below.

# sequences locally, so a green CI run says nothing about a local one.

# is still covered — deliberately, by examples that stub `UI.color?` — rather
# than by accident, differently, on each machine.
